  # This isn't the resolution but the down-sampling factor.
  # For each channel multiplier we down-sample the image
  # by a factor of 2. Hence, the down-sampling factor increases
  # by a factor of 2 for each channel multiplier. For an image
  # with size 64x64 and four channel multipliers, the down-sampling
  # factors are 1, 2, 4, 8. The attention resolutions are then
  # 64, 32, 16, 8.
